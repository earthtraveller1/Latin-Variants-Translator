# Latin Variants Translator

**I am NOT the original author of this project. This is merely a port. All issues related to the project itself should go to the original project [here](https://github.com/anthonyhuang07/Latin-Variants-Translator).

A translator for Pig Latin, Egg Latin, and Bacon Omelette Latin.

Anthony Huang's first project using TypeScript.

**NOTE**: The translators WILL NOT BE PERFECT. There will be several bugs all the translators, so Anthony would really appreciate it if you can open an issue or a pull request to help fix these.
